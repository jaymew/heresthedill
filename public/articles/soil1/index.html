			<h1 class="title">Understanding your soil, Part 1: Seed Compost</h1>
			<p>One thing I realized recently while learning how to container garden is that I could have a better  understanding of soil and the different types available. Sure, I can go to a garden center and blindly pick soil based on the pictures on the bags, but I want to be an active thinker when it comes to the garden and understand the why behind it.</p>

<p>Let’s start from the beginning, with seeds. If you follow other experienced gardeners, they’ll say it’s best to use “seed compost.” The Oxford Dictionary states that compost is “decayed organic material used as a fertilizer for growing plants.” Straight “matured compost” is generally rich in nutrients but it’s not exactly the same thing as seed compost. From what I’ve gathered there’s no official definition of seed compost, so here’s my definition: Seed compost is a loose fine homogenous textured soil low in nutrients which is free draining yet moisture retentive, usually sterile. The breakdown of my definition is as follows.</p>

<p>Texture
Seed compost must be made of a loose, fine texture with the same-sized particles throughout the mix. If you take a handful while its moist and close it in a firm fist, it will hold its shape yet crumble when touched. Think of it as a moist, light, fluffy cake: the kind of cake that holds its shape, yet when eaten with a fork, it creates light, delicate crumbs. A naturally-occurring example of this soil is found in the mounds created by moles. Seedlings are delicate and need to be able to push easily through soil. They contain a limited amount of energy reserves for root and shoot formation. If they empty their reserves pushing through a dense soil before they can create true leaves for photosynthesis, they will almost certainly die before they really have a chance to start. </p>

<p>Seed compost must be low in nutrients. Now, this contradicts the Oxford definition of compost as fertilizer, which is generally high in nutrients. It’s important that the soil be low in nutrients so the seedling develops a robust root system, which in turn creates a strong shoot system for photosynthesis. If the nutrient level is too high, it can “burn” the tender root tips by overwhelming them: the seedlings tend to form hair-thin strands and sparse root systems which do not create a good anchor in strong weather events later in life. A good root system will contain thick strands, more like thin-to-medium-weight yarn. Thicker, denser root systems anchor the plant in the soil and, in turn, hold soil together.</p>

<p>Another hazard is that hair-thin root systems will not work to produce root exudates to attract mycorrhizal fungi and beneficial bacteria. Why should they, when all the nutrients they need are at their feet? Once these nutrients are washed away through frequent waterings and when planted in the ground the seedlings will not be able to call for help in the soil network since they have nothing to exchange for the network’s services. The seedling will surely perish during the first stressful weather event, which can be as simple as a one hot day in spring, let alone a hot dry summer.</p>

<p>Seed compost needs to allow excess water to pass through and hold water without it becoming waterlogged. Waterlogging occurs when roots cannot exchange gases in order to breathe: it is the equivalent of drowning. A few signs are stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and the soil giving off a strange smell due to anaerobic activity/rotting of roots. But water cannot pass through so easily that no water is absorbed, otherwise the seedlings loose turgor pressure and begin to wilt. An important note, most people believe the main sign of waterlogging is when they see water sitting on the surface of the soil for an extended period of time. This is not always the case!  Below is an example of it occurring in my over-hanging balcony pots.</p>

<p>A particular compost I acquired locally was so fine it did not allow enough pore space for adequate gas exchange and clogged some of the draining holes. The top layer would indicate that it was dry, so dry at times it would even crack. Yet when I would lift the pot to check its weight it was heavy indicating it contained plenty of water. While watering, some water would drain through, though slowly. Any seedlings that did poke through the hard top, usually in the cracks, ended up having stunted growth due to suffocation and the nutrient strain of pushing through soil. When I finally decided to change out the soil, it had a foul smell from anaerobic bacterial activity. Soil should have a pleasant smell of XXXXX. if it’s off-putting then it’s bad soil!</p>

<p>Lesson learned! It was clear that this particular compost was for mixing into a fluffier soil within a garden to add nutrients, not to be used alone in a container unless spread thin as top layer additive. </p>

<p>Bacteria
Seed compost is typically sterile. This is the opposite of what was stated in the No-Till Gardening article. Plants benefit from bacteria within the soil but if you’d like your plants to have a healthy start, it’s a good idea for your potting seed compost to be free of pests, diseases and weed seeds. Like a newborn baby, the seedling has an immature immune system that takes a little time to develop. Using a sterile seed compost allows the seedling to focus its energy on growing a small robust root and shoot system so it can fend off pests and diseases in the future and not compete with other seeds that might be present in your soil. Local microbial life will colonize the soil as the seedling develops and more likely than not, they will then help the seedling.</p>

<p>When your seedlings are ready to pot, that’s when you should introduce them to a little of your garden soil. By doing so, the potting soil is inoculated with the microbes and fungi population specific to your garden so the seedlings can begin developing their immune systems. But we’ll get to that in a later post.</p>

<p>So, now that we have a better understanding of seed compost, we can purchase some or create our own. </p>

<p>XXXXPurchasingXXXX</p>

<p>Creating your own seed compost is a 1:1:1 ratio: 1 part pasteurized uniformly-sized soil;1 part sand, vermiculate or perlite; and 1 part coir or peat moss. </p>

<p>If you’re lucky enough to have moles—or unlucky enough depending how you look at it—you could use their hills as part of your mixture so long as it’s that nice, crumbly, cake-like consistency. If you’re also lucky enough to have a worm compost bin you can use the rich loamy soil they create. When neither of these options are available and you have a normal compost bin or plain loamy garden soil in your backyard, you could create sieves to filter out smaller pieces of soil. XXXCreating a sieveXXXXX</p>

<p>XXXXCompost rich in nutrients, how to create a poorer solution?XXXXX</p>

<p>Once you have your uniform soil it’s time to pasteurize it. Pasteurization is a sterilization technique of heating a substance at a certain temperature for specific amount of time to eliminate any harmful pathogens that may be present within the substance without chemically altering the substance. In this case we’ll be using an oven. </p>

<p>Place a thin 1-2cm (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-3/4in) layer of slightly moist compost on an old baking sheet or casserole dish and cover with a lid or foil. Preheat oven to 120C (250F) using an oven thermometer to make sure the oven is accurate and adjust as needed.  Once the soil has reached 60C (140F) bake for additional 30 minutes sustaining the temperature. 10 degrees above 60C (140F) is fine but not much more. It’s important not to overheat the soil which alters the structure, making it useless to the seedlings. It’s a good idea to preform this in a well ventilated area in case of unpleasant odors. Once it cools it’s ready to use.1 A grill could also be used, for an outdoor option. Just be sure to monitor the temperature within the grill and the mixture to prevent overheating.</p>

<p>Side note: As of writing this article I have not tried this baking method (mainly because I do not have access to any of the above options) so I do not know about how long it takes to reach 60C /140F or in regards to lingering smells. I assume if it’s a healthy quality soil it will smell similar to baked beets? If you try this method or have tried this method please share your experience, good or bad, below.</p>

<p>While we’re on the topic of pathogens, if reusing pots or old food containers, it’s important to sanitize these items as well as tools and work surfaces being used for potting. (10-20% bleach solution, 1:8 or 2:9 bleach to water ratio. Do not get any bleach on plants, seeds or soil 1) XXXX</p>

<p>Sand, vermiculite or perlite is the free draining</p>
