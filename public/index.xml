      <description>My name is Jayme and I recently discovered my passion for gardening or rather in plants and their interactions within the world.
I studied biology with a specialization in marine and aquatic biology thinking I wanted to research coral reef ecosystems— thank you Blue Planet and Discovery Channel. But it wasn’t until I started moving further away from home that I realized what I my true interests were, digging in the garden.</description>

      <description>Bicycling is one of my favorite things about living in Germany. There are clearly marked lanes specifically for bicyclists and should you accidently wander into one you will be reminded by angry shouts and ringing bells or- simply run over.
Motorists, the majority of the time, are fairly respectful of bikes at least in the city I live in. But there is one major downside when you don’t have a car and that is space and weight.</description>

      <description>Hi! I’m Jayme, an American expat sharpening her organic gardening and German language skills in beautiful southern Germany. I started gardening at age 10 when my dad dug an egg-shaped garden bed for me out of the lawn one rainy April morning in 2001—that’s true love right there!
Since then I studied biology, expanded my gardening knowledge and bed by stealing one of my mom’s neighboring gardening beds—also true love—and interned for a summer on an organic farm in Northeast Ohio.</description>
