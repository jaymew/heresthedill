      <description>This is the year, the year that I’m finally going to face a fear. In the past I’ve avoided it and paid the price. It’s the seed.
That’s right, I’ve been afraid of starting from seed. Who wants to get their hopes up watching their tiny seedlings grow, only to see them die later?
And I don’t think I’m the only one. But it’s important to learn how to grow from seed—for the sake of our wallets.</description>

      <description>This is the craziest time of the year for gardeners. Everything is growing so fast that we can’t keep up. For a while I managed to keep on top of everything but now I’m falling behind, in both the Kleingarten and my Balkongarten. The most pressing jobs in the Kleingarten, such as the grapevine roof trellis and winter rye cutting, are completed on time, but the balcony has taken a back seat.</description>

      <title>Challenges with the German Language</title>

      <description>Steigstraße
  Living in Germany has its difficulties, particularly as a non-native speaker. In an ideal world I would be able to find everything I need to apply what I preach, but that can be challenging. The most obvious hurdle is language. I don’t know all the German terminology associated with gardening; it’s learn-as-you-go. This can be annoying since I don’t even possess the common knowledge of where to find certain products like I do in the States, not to mention not knowing the names of the products.</description>

      <title>Desktop Greenhouse</title>

      <description>One of my favorite things about gardening is the creative opportunity to construct something when the need arises. While cleaning out a storage closet at work I came across an aquarium and an aquarium light.
Now, my job involves working with fish so this equipment is useful but this aquarium is missing a side panel: not very useful for holding water anymore. This particular aquarium light is not used in the lab anymore either so these items were destined for the Auspackraum, the recycling / trash room within the University.</description>

      <description>Fahrradstraße, or &amp;#39;bike street&amp;#39;
  Bicycling is one of my favorite things about living in Germany. There are clearly-marked lanes specifically for bicyclists and should you accidently wander into one, you will be reminded by angry shouts and ringing bells, or simply run over.
Motorists, the majority of the time, are fairly respectful of bikes, at least in the city I live in. But there is one major downside when you don’t have a car and that is space.</description>

      <title>Starting Your Seed Calendar</title>

      <description>I think everyone loves the idea of growing from seed but most people are afraid to do it. It’s time to get over that fear—me included—mainly because they are much cheaper than buying plants at the store and are much more rewarding. There are also more varieties to choose from than what you’ll find in stores. But before you plant seeds it’s best to know when to plant them for the most success, and this is where a seed calendar comes in handy.</description>

      <description>My name is Jayme and I recently discovered my passion for gardening, or rather, in plants and their interactions within the world.
I studied biology with a specialization in marine and aquatic biology thinking I wanted to research coral reef ecosystems—thank you Blue Planet and Discovery Channel. But it wasn’t until I started moving further away from home that I realized what my true interests were: digging in the garden.</description>

      <description>Me!
  Hi! I’m Jayme, an American expat sharpening her organic gardening and German language skills in beautiful southern Germany. I started gardening at age 10 when my dad dug an egg-shaped garden bed for me out of the lawn one rainy April morning in 2001—that’s true love right there!
Since then I studied biology, expanded my gardening knowledge and bed by stealing one of my mom’s neighboring gardening beds—also true love—and interned for a summer on an organic farm in Northeast Ohio.</description>
