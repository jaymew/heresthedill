		<h2>Challenges with the German Language</h2>

		<p>Living in Germany has its difficulties, particularly as a non-native speaker. In an ideal world I would be able to find and apply everything I preach but that can be challenging. The most obvious is language. I don’t know all the German terminology associated with gardening; it’s learn-as-you-go. This can be annoying since I don’t even possess the common knowledge of where to find certain products like I do in the States, not to mention not knowing the names of the products.</p>

<p>For example, where can one find speciality spring bulbs? In the US, I can instantly name a few familiar nurseries (Brent &amp; Becky’s, Burpee, Spring Hill, Gurney’s, etc) and then rank them in speciality, quality and expense to decide which nursery to order from.</p>

<p>Now, tell me, where I can buy spring bulbs in Germany?</p>

<p>Let’s walk through the process.</p>

<p>The literal translation for spring bulb is Frühlingszwiebel but Zwiebel also means onion. Search ‘Frühlingszwiebel’ brings up sites selling green onion bulbs.</p>

<p>Think of a specific spring bulb in order to refine the search, Tulip. What’s the German name? Translation site, Tulpe, search, first result a company named Albrecht Hoch.de, looks like a nice spring bulb site, no mention of the word spring bulb.</p>

<p>Next result, Samen Mauser.ch, a Swiss site. Can’t easily order from there since it’s out of the country and currency but lists Blumenzwiebel. Of course! Flowering bulb! Why didn’t I think of that? Type in Blumenzwiebel, search, finally multiple results.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to sort through and rank which nurseries are best to order from. Start next research process.</p>

<p>Most of the time it’s fun to research and learn the <strong>German name</strong> of a plant. A favorite of mine is Stiefmütterchen which translates ‘little step mother’ for pansies <em>Viola tricolor hortensis</em> and Fingerhut, ‘finger hat’ foxglove <em>Digitalis purpurea</em>.</p>


<figure class="alignright">

<p>But it’s also a pain when I want to quickly look something up, or if I’m in a store trying to decipher a label. Not only do I need to learn the new word I have to retain it, something I’m not the best at.</p>

<p>A huge hurdle when learning German is memorizing words. I’m terrible! And yet, I love learning the language. I’m not entirely sure why: it’s not the prettiest to listen to, although I’d argue it’s not as ugly as most make it out to be. Many examples Americans hear are in anger, which emphasizes the harshness of the language, but in everyday speech it’s pleasant. The grammar is difficult, to put it mildly. It’s frustrating when you don’t understand a rule but so satisfying once you finally do and can move on to the next frustrating one. It’s definitely a love-hate relationship.</p>

<p>The owner of the garden constantly has to repeat the German names of the plants in the garden. I’ve started to think I should start labeling them with hanging tags in order to memorize everything. Can you imagine seeing large brightly colored tags with bold names hanging off of everything in a garden?</p>

<p>Although— I am attempting to memorize latin names too since it’s the international identification language. This might not be a bad idea. I think I might just become that crazy American this weekend who labels everything.</p>

<p>My name is Jayme and I recently discovered my passion for gardening or rather in plants and their interactions within the world.</p>

<p>I studied biology with a specialization in marine and aquatic biology thinking I wanted to research coral reef ecosystems— thank you Blue Planet and Discovery Channel. But it wasn’t until I started moving further away from home that I realized what I my true interests were, digging in the garden.</p>

<p>On this journey I hope to go from a knowledgeable gardener to full out nerdy expert and share my geeky gardening tendencies with others who have the same passion. This is a space to gain a deeper understanding of the natural processes occurring in your garden. I’ll also explore agricultural and environmental topics surrounding plants in order to understand world wide conversations over climate change and what we as individuals can do to help.</p>

<h2 id="without-further-ado-welcome-to-here-s-the-dill">Without further ado, Welcome to Here’s the Dill!</h2>

<p>It started around the age of 9 watching my dad turn an overgrown 1.5 acre (0.6 hectare) plot of land into lawn and a series of garden beds. He worked hard digging out forgotten stumps located within a thorny, thistly, poison ivy stricken meadow and I got to help. Saturday and Sunday mornings were spent watching gardening programs with my parents on HGTV; you know when the Home and GARDENING Network used to air gardening shows. (Can you tell I was a nerdy kid?) Anyhow, one rainy spring morning, I asked him if I could have a garden bed, thinking he wouldn’t take me seriously I went upstairs to play. But within a few minutes he went out into the drizzling rain and dug a small egg shaped bed around a tiny flowering crabapple tree and a patch of peonies. Over the years the bed expanded as I stole one of my mom’s neighboring garden beds and unbeknownst to me, so was my passion for being in the garden.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize that every time I visited home from college or when I got my first professional job further away I was always drawn back to my garden. During college I even planted spring bulbs in front of the house my roommates and I occupied. It wasn’t until I moved from Ohio to southern Germany how much I craved needing to be in one. My lifeline was cut; I could not on a whim visit my parents and work in the garden. I didn’t realize how much I relied on gardening to reduce stress and no matter how much you prepare, moving halfway across the world is a fairly stressful event.</p>

<p>I’ve been living in Germany for over 2 years and have since created a balcony garden and recently starting working in an allotment garden thanks to a kind member of the community. On Here’s the Dill I hope to share my successes and failures of organic gardening along with any interesting topics about agriculture or ecological interactions occurring within a garden. Together we’ll become better gardeners and more conscious citizens of the world!</p>

		<h2>Cycling</h2>
		<div class="meta-box">
    	<br/><span class="date-day">14</span>
      <br/><span class="date-mon-year">Feb 19</span>

		<p>Bicycling is one of my favorite things about living in Germany. There are clearly marked lanes specifically for bicyclists and should you accidently wander into one you will be reminded by angry shouts and ringing bells or- simply run over.</p>

<p>Motorists, the majority of the time, are fairly respectful of bikes at least in the city I live in. But there is one major downside when you don’t have a car and that is space and weight.</p>

<p>Think about it, when you go to the nursery you’re able to fill up your car with trays of plants, a few bags of soil or mulch, maybe the tools you’ll need and still have some room leftover in your car or pickup.</p>

<p>Me? I have this.</p>

<p>You can barely fit 5 plants in that basket! The one advantage is it prevents impulse purchases. I always have to go in knowing what materials or plants I need and then figure out how to squeeze them on my bike without damaging them. Although this isn’t always the case. In the above photo I went to the store to buy large bag of potting soil and ended up leaving with 70% off houseplants- no potting soil.</p>

<p>And since I own a mens bike which requires swinging a leg around the back forget about tall plants too. I learned this the hard way with a climbing rose and clematis I purchased in 2017.</p>

<p>Picture a woman in the parking lot hesitantly raising her foot 20 times over deciding whether she’ll make it over the bike without falling over. I wandered around the parking lot eventually finding a curb to make the swing distance shorter. Only issue was forgetting when I arrived home and proceeded to fall into a bush next to the building. This is the one time where learning the splits would have been useful.</p>

<p>Point is space is an issue. And in connection so is weight. I’m not able to buy giant bags of soil. If it can’t fit in my backpack or basket it can’t be transported. Luckily my store has some compressed soil, which barely fits in my pack, but is lighter than everything else. It just requires more water to rejuvenate it during planting. Now that I think about it, it might be compressible if it’s full of peat which is great for plants but not for the environment. I’ll have to read the bag again to see if it is full of peat. I might lose my convient soil bag.</p>

<p>Thanks to the owner of the garden I do have access to a kid trailer it’s just a matter of coordinating when to pick it up. The city also has special cargo bikes people can rent too.</p>

<p>There is also the component of inclines. In order to cross the Rhein bicyclists must go up spiral bike ramps to reach the bridges.</p>

<p>Or in a the case of some unfortunate plant loving friends, they must climb a large hill to reach home. It’s definitely a planned effort for them when they starting planting their large balcony garden.</p>

<p>Thankfully I only have to worry about the ramps to reach the garden center. I will admit when carting heavy items around town I do not find biking fun anymore. Another love hate relationship while living in Germany.</p>
