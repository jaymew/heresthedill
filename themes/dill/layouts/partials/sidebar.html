If you are as nerdy and passionate about gardening as I am, welcome!

I’ve always worked in a garden and I’ve constantly been curious to the why behind many processes in the garden. Plants and their interactions within the world have constantly fascinated me and this website is an exploration to those nagging questions that we all come across while gardening. I really want to gain a deeper understanding of the biological, ecological and chemical mechanisms occurring in our gardens, as well as agricultural and environmental topics surrounding food in order to become a better gardener and a more conscious citizen of the world. Successes and failures will be shared along with any research behind them.
