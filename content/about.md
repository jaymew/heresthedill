Jayme is a American living in southern Germany who didnâ€™t realize what her interests were until moving halfway across the world. Severed from her tiny garden in Ohio she has created this website to explore if her nerdy interest in plants and their interactions within the world is where her passion lies. On this journey she hopes to go from a knowledgeable gardener to full-out nerdy expert and share her geeky gardening tendencies with others who have the same passion. This is a space to gain a deeper understanding of biological, ecological and chemical mechanisms occurring in the garden and to explore agricultural and environmental topics surrounding plants in order to understand world wide conversations over climate change and what we as individuals can do to help.
