Hi! I’m Jayme, an American expat sharpening her organic gardening and German language skills in beautiful southern Germany. I started gardening at age 10 when my dad dug an egg-shaped garden bed for me out of the lawn one rainy April morning in 2001—that’s true love right there!

Since then I studied biology, expanded my gardening knowledge and bed by stealing one of my mom’s neighboring gardening beds—also true love—and interned for a summer on an organic farm in Northeast Ohio. Now I’m learning permaculture methods from a kind member of the community who I call der Chef.

I’ll share my successes and struggles from my balcony garden and der Garten des Chefs (the boss’s garden; gotta make that language school count!) an allotment garden located over the border in northern Switzerland in order to help myself and others become better growers.
