Hi! I’m Jayme, an American expat sharpening her organic gardening and German language skills in beautiful southern Germany. I started gardening at age 10 when my dad dug an egg-shaped garden bed for me out of the lawn one rainy April morning in 2001—that’s true love right there!

Since then I studied biology, expanded my gardening knowledge and bed by stealing one of my mom’s neighboring gardening beds—also true love—and interned for a summer on an organic farm in Northeast Ohio. Now I’m learning permaculture methods from a kind member of the community who I call der Chef.

I’ll share my successes and struggles from my balcony garden and der Garten des Chefs (the boss’s garden; gotta make that language school count!) an allotment garden located over the border in northern Switzerland in order to help myself and others become better growers.

If you have any questions or comments, please reach out! I love connecting with other gardeners and like-minded people around the globe! You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hereisthedill) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hereisthedill/), or email me directly at [hereisthedill@gmail.com](mailto:hereisthedill@gmail.com).
